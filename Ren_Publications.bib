	abstract = {Electrochemically generated bubbles are gaining increasing attention for their detrimental effects on the efficiency of electrocatalysis involving gaseous products, including hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). As a model system, bubble nucleation is also of fundamental interest. Herein, we report a single-entity approach to map the nucleation of H2 bubbles on polycrystalline Pt via scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM). Individual H2 bubbles ( approximately 500 nm radius) are generated via HER in the attoliter electrochemical cell of an SECCM instrument. Nucleation and growth of a H2 bubble results in a characteristic voltammetric peak current, which is related to the concentration and activation energy required for nucleation. By mapping the local voltammograms at various locations on the polycrystalline Pt, we found a heterogeneous distribution of energetics of nucleation for H2 bubbles on the Pt surface. However, such heterogeneity is not correlated with crystal grains or grain boundaries.},

Herein, we report the controlled formation of individual CO2 nanobubbles at Pt nanoelectrodes via the electrooxidation of formate. The electrochemical data are used to extract key parameters of CO2 gas nucleation. We determine that CO2 bubbles nucleate when the concentration of CO2 at the Pt electrode is greater than approximately 0.6 M, corresponding to supersaturation of approximately 18.

	abstract = {Photoinduced-RAFT polymerization is a technique of increasing interest due to the combination of control over polymerization that RAFT processes afford with the mild reaction conditions and spatial and temporal control of photochemical processes. Iniferter RAFT polymerization is an interesting subclass of photoinduced-RAFT that eliminates the need for an added photocatalyst, as the RAFT agent is directly excited by the photon source. Iniferter RAFT is a photochemical process leading to carbon–sulfur bond homolysis. In this work we find a surprising effect of substituents on the dithiobenzoate moiety of the chain transfer agent (CTA). Donating groups dramatically accelerate the iniferter process, while withdrawing groups retard the reaction substantially. This is interpreted though electrochemistry, since homolysis of the carbon–sulfur bond is associated with a formal oxidation of the thiocarbonylthio groups and reduction of the carbon to a radical. Through this study, the unique efficiency of 2-cyano-2-propyl 4-methoxydithiobenzoate (CPMODB) as an iniferter was uncovered, as this polymerization was found to progress at a drastically enhanced rate, even when compared to similar tris[2-phenylpyridinato-C2,N]iridium(iii) photocatalyzed polymerizations using an unsubstituted dithiobenzoate RAFT agent.},

Studies using single crystals suggest a polycrystalline surface should display an inhomogeneous distribution of PZC and electric field, which directly affects the electrochemical energy storage and conversion processes occurring at the electrode-electrolyte interface. Herein, we demonstrate the direct mapping of local PZC using scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM). The potential-dependent charging current upon the formation of the microscopic electrode-electrolyte interface is used to determine the PZC. Using polycrystalline Pt as a model system, correlative SECCM and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) images show the dependence of PZC on the local crystal grain orientation. The electrocatalytic activity can be mapped from the same SECCM experiment via local voltammetry, which demonstrates the variation of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity across Pt grains. The method reported here can be readily applied to study other electrochemical interfaces, providing rich correlative information on the surface property and electrocatalytic activities.},

Probabilistic and statistical interpretation can generate insights matching or superseding those from macroscale/ensemble measurements, revealing phenomena that were hitherto averaged over. Herein, we review recent literature examples of stochastic processes in single-entity electrochemistry, highlighting strategies for interpreting stochasticity, contrasting them with macroscale measurements and describing the insights generated.},

Its capability for local electrochemistry mapping helps to reveal the heterogeneity in the electrode kinetics and mechanisms, which are otherwise averaged out in ensemble measurements. Accurate determination of the electrode kinetics requires the careful assessment of the ohmic potential drop in the solution, i.e., the iR drop. Herein, the iR drop in SECCM experiments is assessed. We showed that the iR drop in single-barrel SECCM can be estimated using the solution conductivity and pipette geometry, or the mass transfer limiting current without the assumption of pipette geometry. For dual-barrel SECCM, we developed a method of measuring the solution resistance directly, which can be used to compensate for the iR drop and the potential shift in the experiments. These methods offer a convenient way to estimate and compensate for the iR drop in SECCM, allowing the more accurate measurement of local electrode kinetics for the determination of local mechanisms in electrocatalysis.},

	abstract = {Elucidating the structure-activity relationship in electrocatalysis is of fundamental interest for electrochemical energy conversion and storage. However, the heterogeneity in the surface structure of electrocatalysts, including the presence of various facets, poses an analytical challenge in revealing the true structure-activity relationship because the activity is conventionally measured on ensemble, resulting in an averaged activity that cannot be unequivocally associated with a single structural motif. Scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) [1] combined with colocalized electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) offers a direct way to reveal the correlative local electrochemical and structural information. Herein, we measured the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity on Ag and its dependence on the crystal orientation. From the combined EBSD and SECCM mapping, it is found that Ag grains closer to \{111\} show a higher exchange current density, while those closer to \{110\} show a lower Tafel slope. The Tafel slope is also found to decrease with the step density increase. The ability to measure the electrocatalytic activity under a high mass-transfer rate allows us to reveal the activity difference at a high current density (up to 200 mA/cm2). The approach reported here can be expanded to other systems to reveal the nature of active sites of electrocatalysis.},

They also provide a platform for the study of various of interface effect in PEC. Here, we report a new kind of mixed-dimensional vdWs heterostructure photoelectrode and investigate the strain enhanced PEC performance at vdWs interfaces. Our heterostructures are composed of 2D n-type MoS2 nanosheets and three-dimensional (3D) p-type Cu2O nanorod arrays (NRAs), where Cu2O NRAs introduce periodically strain in the p-n junction interface. We find a promotion of the HER catalytic activities in heterostructure based PEC photoelectrodes using in-situ measurement techniques including the scanning electrochemical cell microscopy and various local spectrum probe measurements. This is attributed to the efficient charge separation at the strained heterointerface. Our results demonstrate an interesting venue for understanding the local interface effects with high spatial resolution, and shed light on design and developing high-efficiency photoelectrodes. 1L MoS2/Cu2O vdWs heterostructure photocathodes were prepared by nanoindentation technology.

Herein, we experimentally elucidate the structural and energetic effect of grain boundary on metal dissolution reaction by colocalized scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) and electron microscopy assisted by focused ion beam (FIB). The local dissolution activity at isolated locations containing only single grain boundaries is measured from SECCM. The structure and orientation of the same grain boundary planes are characterized by electron backscatter diffraction and FIB, which is confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The relative interfacial energy of these grain boundaries is also measured via the thermal grooving method. Using anodic dissolution at Ag grain boundaries as a model system, we found that the dissolution rate increases with grain boundary energy and the density of broken bonds at the grain boundary plane. The results explain the heterogeneity in the activity of metal dissolution at different grain boundaries, elucidating the initiation sites of metal dissolution. The method developed here is generally applicable to revealing the structure− activity correlation of electrochemical reactions at grain boundaries.},

Dual-channel nanopipettes can often serve as the probe, and a voltage bias between the channels can control the local electrolyte environment via migration and electroosmotic flow (EOF). The ability to elucidate and predict the contribution of each transport is desirable. In this work, we measured the limiting current of different redox molecules to experimentally elucidate the contribution of migration and EOF at the droplet-substrate interface in SECCM. The results were further supported by fluorescence imaging and finite element modeling. We showed that redox mediators with high charge, such as Ru(NH3)63+, migration contributes 5× as much mass transport limiting current compared to EOF when a bias voltage is applied. The exact contribution of each mode at a given potential bias depends on the electrical double layer structure, which can be tuned by the surface charge and solution composition. The contribution can be quantitatively predicted in the finite element model. Our findings will enable the precise control of mass transport in dual-channel SECCM and potentially open new scanning modes in SECCM via precise control of reaction flux.},

Herein, we report the measurement of rates and energetics of electronucleation across the model surface of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG). Specifically, scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) is used to confine the nucleation spatially in the nanoscale cell, allowing one nucleation event to be measured at one time. The scanning capability further allows the mapping of Ag nucleation at the step edge vs basal plane. A stochastic model is developed to extract the nucleation rate and energetics from voltammetric experiments. We observed a ∼57 mV difference in the median nucleation overpotential between the step edge and basal plane, corresponding to a ∼12 kJ mol–1 difference in the nucleation energy barrier. The voltammetric method to measure the nucleation rate explored here can be extended to understand the heterogeneity of nucleation rates in other electrochemical nucleation systems, e.g., metal anode batteries.},

Understanding the effect of gas transfer on the electrochemistry at this three-phase interface is a grand challenge. Scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) is an emerging technique for mapping the heterogeneity in electrochemical activity; it also inherently features a three-phase boundary at the nanodroplet cell. Herein, we quantitatively analyze the role of the three-phase boundary in SECCM involving gas via finite element simulation. Oxygen reduction reaction is used as an example for reaction with a gas reactant, which shows that interfacial gas transfer can enhance the overall mass transport of reactant, allowing measuring current density of several A/cm2. The hydrogen evolution reaction is used as an example for reaction with a gas product, and fast interfacial gas transfer kinetics can significantly reduce the concentration of dissolved gas near the electrode. This helps to measure electrode kinetics at a high current density without the complication of gas bubble formation. The contribution of interfacial gas transfer can be understood by directly comparing its kinetics to the mass transfer coefficient from the solution. Our findings aid the quantitative application of SECCM in studying electrochemical reactions involving gases, establishing a basis for investigating electrochemistry at the three-phase boundary.},

Atomic-scale electron probes and energetic calculations elucidate how exsolution-self-assembly is tunable using knowledge of point defect interactions. We leverage this to then demonstrate a high-throughput synthesis and screening strategy to fabricate a library of Cu-ESO tandem CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) electrodes. Electrocatalytic mapping and localized physicochemical analyses reveal structure-property relationships between local Cu valence and CO2RR activity, identifying operating potentials and electrode surface chemistries that favor CO2RR over competitive hydrogen evolution. This high-throughput synthesis-screening approach can accelerate development of advanced electrocatalysts and nanocomposite materials for many applications given its compatibility with entropy-designed materials and physical vapor deposition at/near silicon volume manufacturing temperatures.},

This is achieved by applying an oscillating potential between the ORR operating potential and anion adsorbing potential on a gold electrode. Oscillating potential enhances the selectivity for H2O2 by up to 1.35 times compared to the static potential, as confirmed by rotating ring-disk electrode and fluorescence assay measurements. We showed that the enhanced selectivity depends on dynamic adsorption and desorption of anions, and the enhancement occurs in the millisecond time scale or shorter. The transient selectivity to H2O2 can reach ∼97\% within the first 5 ms after potential switching. Our results suggest that the dynamic interface can create a transient but unique microenvironment for new reactivity that cannot be reproduced under static conditions, which offers a new dimension in controlling electrocatalysis.},

Herein, we combine scanning electrochemical cell microscopy with identical-location microscopies to reveal the heterogeneity in the breakdown of NiO film on Ni in a site-by-site manner. Local critical breakdown potential varies by ∼500 mV, corresponding to an excess energy of 0.02–0.12 J/m2. Correlative composition imaging using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry shows Ni crystal grains with thinner NiO films are more resistant to breakdown. This high resistance is explained using classical nucleation theory, where the electrical energy is affected by the film thickness through the local interfacial capacitance. The correlative imaging approach overcomes the issue of heterogeneity, providing conclusive insight into the stability of the electrochemical interfaces.},

The screening is performed on isolated ∼μm2 areas in SECCM, enabling multiple experimental conditions to be evaluated in a single mapping experiment. The screening reveals that the formation of (100) facets in Pt nanoparticles is sensitive to the upper and lower potential limits of the square-wave potential pulse. The facet selectivity is attributed to a facet-dependent migration effect influenced by the concurrent hydrogen evolution reaction during Pt deposition. Moreover, the density and size of nanoparticles can be controlled. This approach offers a pathway toward automated synthesis and characterization of faceted metallic nanoparticles, providing opportunities for advancements in electrocatalysis and sensor development.},

	abstract = {Electrochemical metal dissolution reaction is a fundamental process in various critical technologies, including metal anode batteries and nanofabrication. However, experimentally revealing the kinetics and dynamics of active sites of metal dissolution reactions is challenging. Herein, we investigate metal dissolution on near-perfect single-crystal surfaces of Ag within regions of a few hundred nanometers isolated by scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM). Potential oscillation is observed under constant current conditions for dissolution. The one-to-one correspondence between the dissolution charge and the geometry of the dissolution pit from colocalized imaging allows ambiguous correlation, which suggests that each oscillation cycle corresponds to the dissolution of one atomic layer. The oscillation behavior is further explained in a kinetic model, which reveals that the oscillation comes from the dynamic evolution of the number of different active sites as the dissolution progresses on each atomic layer. In addition to the fundamental interest, the ability to observe layer-by-layer dissolution in electrochemical measurements suggests a potential pathway for developing electrochemical atomic layer etching for fabricating structures and devices with atomic precision.},

	abstract = {AbstractBimetallic heterostructures, including core–shell and Janus configurations, often offer unique electrocatalytic properties compared to monometallic nanoparticles. However, achieving precise control over both elemental composition and spatial arrangement within these structures remains a challenge. Here, an electrosynthesis method is introduced that enables the fabrication of heterostructured bimetallic nanoparticles with precise, independent control of their elemental distribution. By leveraging dual‐channel scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM), the local ionic environment is dynamically modulated in situ, adjusting the deposition bias between channels to achieve selective electrodeposition. This approach allows temporal control over the solution conditions within the SECCM droplet, facilitating the synthesis of multi‐layer core–shell nanoparticles with tunable thickness, number, and sequence of layers. This technique is demonstrated with Pt–Cu and Pt–Ni systems, synthesizing arrays of Cu@Pt and Pt@Cu core–shell structures, which are then screened for catalytic activity in hydrogen evolution (HER) and oxygen reduction (ORR) reactions. The high spatial resolution and on‐demand control over the composition and structure make this method well‐suitable for creating arrays of complex, multi‐metallic heterostructures, which is expected to accelerate the discovery of advanced electrocatalytic materials, offering a platform for efficient and scalable electrocatalyst screening.},

	abstract = {Water structuring critically influences reactivity in aqueous electrocatalysis, yet the roles of interfacial water networks in electrode kinetics remain poorly defined. Here, we use the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on Pt in acidic media to investigate how modifications to the bulk and interfacial water networks, achieved through the introduction of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), alter HER kinetics. Ultramicroelectrode measurements, with high mass transfer rate and low solution resistance, isolate intrinsic HER kinetics at the DMSO-free regions of the Pt surface. DMSO adsorption blocks HER, but activity on water-rich regions remains stable until the water-covered area drops below 30\%, where HER kinetics sharply decline, and the hydrogen adsorption step becomes ratelimiting. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations reveal that the adsorbed DMSO confines the interfacial water clusters and disrupts the hydrogen bonding. When the resulting interfacial water clusters become sufficiently small, interfacial proton delivery is impeded, retarding the overall HER kinetics. These findings demonstrate how interfacial water confinement offers a strategy to modulate electrocatalysis beyond conventional surface modifications.},

          , 
            
              Electrochemical nitrate reduction is an attractive pathway to synthesize ammonia from abundant nitrate sources. Copper (Cu) is an active catalyst for this transformation; however, its stability is often compromised by oxidation and leaching during electrocatalysis. Herein, we investigated the encapsulation of Cu nanoparticles inside carbon nanotubes (Cu-in-CNT), which significantly enhances both their structural and electrochemical stability compared to Cu nanoparticles supported on the outer surface (Cu-on-CNT). Encapsulation provides a protective environment that preserves the structure of the catalyst. Post-catalysis analysis reveals that Cu-in-CNT retains its metallic state, whereas Cu-on-CNT undergoes transformation to and CuO to Cu and Cu

              O. After 12 hours of continuous nitrate reduction, Cu-in-CNT exhibits much less Cu leaching (5.3 wt\%) compared to Cu-on-CNT (20.5 wt\%). Furthermore, Cu-in-CNT maintains a stable faradaic efficiency for nitrite and ammonia combined (∼80\%), in contrast to significant declined observed for Cu-on-CNT (∼40\%).},
